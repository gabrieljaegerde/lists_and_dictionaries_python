# Python Further Functions Assignment

Welcome to your next Python assignment! This set of exercises will help you build upon the foundational knowledge you've gained in your previous lessons. You'll be practicing a variety of skills, from calculating areas of shapes to working with strings and numbers in different contexts.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Calculate Area of Shapes
In this exercise, you will create a function called `calculate_area` that will calculate the area of different geometric shapes. The function should be able to calculate the area of a square, rectangle, triangle, and circle.

### Exercise 2: Find the Longest Palindromic Substring
Build upon your string manipulation skills with this exercise. Your task is to create a function called `longest_palindromic_substring` that finds and returns the longest substring in a given string that reads the same backward as forward.

### Exercise 3: Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
Enhance your mathematical programming skills with this exercise. You are required to create a function called `gcd` that takes two numbers as inputs and returns their greatest common divisor.

### Exercise 4: Check for Balanced Brackets
In this exercise, you will be working with strings and stacks. Your task is to create a function called `are_brackets_balanced` that checks if the brackets in a given string are balanced or not. 

### Bonus Exercise: Convert Number to Roman Numerals
As a bonus challenge, you will create a function called `to_roman` that converts a number to its Roman numeral representation.

## Instructions
- For each exercise, you'll find a Python file containing a function skeleton and unit tests.
- Your task is to complete the function implementation so that all unit tests pass.
- Make use of the resources and reference materials available to you to successfully complete these exercises.
- Don't hesitate to collaborate with your peers or seek guidance if you find yourself stuck.

## Grading
Your assignment will be auto-graded based on the provided test.
