2. **Generate Squares**: Implement a function `generate_squares` that returns a dictionary where keys are numbers from 1 to n and values are their squares.
3. **Merge Lists**: Implement a function `merge_lists` that merges two lists in an alternating fashion.
4. **Multiply Keys**: Implement a function `multiply_keys` that replicates the dictionary keys based on their respective values.
